Here is a clear and simple explanation for you:
✅ What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool. It is mainly used for:
Purpose
Meaning
Configuration Management
Install packages, update config files, manage services on servers automatically
Application Deployment
Deploy applications on many servers at once
Provisioning
Create servers in cloud like AWS automatically
Orchestration
Manage multiple servers and their tasks in a sequence
✅ Why do we use Ansible?
To save time by automating repeated tasks
To manage hundreds of servers from one control machine
No agent required on client servers (only SSH is enough)
Very easy to learn (uses YAML language in playbooks)
✅ How Ansible works (Simple Flow)
You have a Control Node (your Ansible server)
You have Managed Nodes (your client servers)
Ansible connects to the clients using SSH
It executes tasks using Playbooks (YAML files)
✅ Example Ansible Playbook (Easy to Understand)
Copy code
Yaml
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
This will install httpd on all servers in the webservers group.
✅ Where Ansible is used?
