## âœ… What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool used to automate:
Purpose

Meaning
Configuration Management
Install packages, update config files, manage services on servers automatically
Application Deployment
Deploy applications on many servers at once
Provisioning
Create servers in cloud (AWS, etc.) automatically
Orchestration
Manage multiple servers and their tasks in a sequence

## âœ… Why do we use Ansible?
Saves time by automating repeated tasks
Manage hundreds of servers from a single control machine
Agentless (only SSH is needed)
Very easy to learn (YAML-based playbooks)

## âœ… How Ansible Works (Simple Flow)
1. You have a Control Node (Ansible server)
2. You have Managed Nodes (client servers)
3. Ansible connects to the clients using SSH
4. It executes tasks using Playbooks (YAML files)

## âœ… Example Ansible Playbook
Copy code
Yaml
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
ðŸ“Œ This playbook will install httpd on all servers in the webservers group.
